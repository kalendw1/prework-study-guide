# Kalen's Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

My motivation for building this project was to learn to code while building a guide for future use to help me study while I navigate the coding bootcamp. I am new to coding so it was not easy, but it was a great project for learning a few of the fundamentals of basic programming languages.


## Installation

N/A

## Usage

 Each section contains notes about a coding topic. The project includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git. And if we open the DevTools console, we can see the JavaScript running. It lists the topics I learned from prework and then chooses a topic to study first. This will be helpful as I need to refresh on certain topics related to coding.
